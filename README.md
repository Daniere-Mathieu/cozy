Hi! This is my [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) config. Thanks for checking it out!

I use a lot of command line tools to manage my daily life. The primary goal of this setup is to integrate all of them into one easy to use and easy on the eyes information dashboard.

# Features
## Main dashboard
This is my life at a glance. Includes music player, events, tasks, pomodoro timer, and habit tracker.

## Time-tracking
Custom Pomodoro tracker!

## Finances
Integrated with [Ledger](https://github.com/ledger/)!

Ledger is a command-line plaintext accounting system. With my dashboard, I can view my current account balances, latest transactions, total monthly spending (with a very nice spending breakdown chart), and more.

## Habit
Integrated with [Pixela](https://pixe.la/)!

Pixela is a habit/effort tracker that operates entirely through an API. I use it because 1) it's pretty, 2) it's available on every platform I use, and 3) it can be easily integrated into anything because it's just a bunch of API calls.

## Vim-like navigational keybinds
My editor of choice is Vim, so naturally I had to include Vim-like controls.
