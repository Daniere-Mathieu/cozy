Hi! This is my [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) config. Thanks for checking it out!

The primary goal of this setup is to create an environment that:
  1. can be used easily on both my laptop and my touchscreen tablet
  2. integrates all the cli tools I use to manage my life into a nice dashboard
  3. looks awesome!

**NOTE: This setup is very much incomplete and this repo is very messy.**
