in pursuit of the perfect rice

I use a lot of cli tools to manage my daily life. This config integrates all of them into one easy to use and easy on the eyes information dashboard.

# Features
## Main dashboard
Life at a glance. Includes music player, calendar, tasks, pomodoro timer, and habit tracker.

## Time-tracking
Custom Pomodoro tracker!

## Finances
Integrated with [Ledger](https://github.com/ledger/)!

Ledger is a command-line plaintext accounting system. View your current account balances, latest transactions, monthly spending, and more.

## Habit
Integrated with [Pixela](https://pixe.la/)!

Pixela is a habit/effort tracker that operates entirely through an API.

View and update your daily habits through a dashboard.

Pixela also has an iOS application, so you can track your habits on the go and have your data waiting for you whenever you get back to your computer.

## Vim-like navigational keybinds
Navigate through tabs with ease.
