Hi! This is my [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) config. Thanks for checking it out!

The primary goal of this setup is to create an environment that 1) can be used on both my laptop and my tablet, and 2) integrate all the cli tools I use to manage my life into a nice dashboard.

# Dashboard
![dashboard: main tab](.github/assets/dash_main.png | width=500)

Features:
- Fancy music player (credit: [rxhyn](https://github.com/rxyhn/yoru))
- Google Calendar events widget
- Taskwarrior tasks widget
- Pomodoro timer
- Habit tracker (integrated with [Pixela](https://pixe.la/))
- Fancy finances (w/ [Ledger](https://github.com/ledger/))
  - Monthly spending tracker
  - Current account balances
- Vim-like keybinds to move between dashboard tabs
