<h1 align="center">Cozy</h1>

<p>Hi! This is Cozy, my AwesomeWM config. Its focus is creating widgets that increase my efficiency and productivity by
integrating various command-line programs like gcalcli, Taskwarrior, Timewarrior, Ledger, and more. Thanks for checking
it out!</p>

<h3>Other stuff</h3>
<b>Why is it called 'cozy'?</b>

I've spent a lot of time tweaking this setup to be just the way I like it, so now this setup feels very personal, comfortable, and cozy. :-)

<b>Why write this with Awesome and not a "proper" UI framework?</b>

Awesome is robust and unbelievably easy to use, and development with it is really, really fast. Since this is just a hobby and frontend development has nothing to do with my career skillset, learning a different framework would be a waste of time.
